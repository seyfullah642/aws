EBS (Elastic Block Storage) Overview

  EBS
    - Storage volumes you can attach to your EC2 instances
    - Create a file system
    - Run a database
    - Run an operating system
    - Store data
    - Install apps

  Mission Critical
    - Production Workloads: Designed for mission-critical workloads
    - Highly Available: Automatically replicated within a single AZ to protect against hardware failure
    - Scalable: Dynamically increase capacity and change the volume type with no downtime or performance impact to your live systems

  EBS Volume Types: Solid State Disk 
    - General Purpose SSD (gp2): A Balance of price and performance

    GP2
      - 3 IOPS per GiB, up to a maximum of 16,000 IOPS per volume
      - gp2 volumes smaller than 1TB can burst up to 3,000 IOPS
      - Good for boot volumes or development and test apps that are not latency Sensitive
    
    GP3
      - Predictable 3,000 IOPS baseline performance and 125 MiB/s regardless of volume size
      - Ideal for app that require high performance at a low cost, such as MySQL, Cassandra, virtual desktop, and Hadoop analytics
      - Customers looking for higher performance can scale up to 16,000 IOPS and 1,000 MiB/s for an additional fee
      - The top performance of gp3 is 4 times faster than max throughput of gp2 volumes

    Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)
      - The high-performance option and the most expensive
      - Up to 64,000 IOPS per volume. 50 IOPS per GiB
      - Use if you need more than 16,000 IOPS
      - Designed for I/O-intensive apps, large databases, and latency-sensitive workloads

    Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)
      - Latest generation
      - Higher durability and more IOPS
      - Up to 64,000 IOPS per volume. 500 IOPS per GiB
      - 99.999% durability

  EBS Volume Types: Hard Disk Drive (MB/s-Instensive)
    
    Optimized HDD (st1)
      - Low-cost HDD volume
      - Baseline throughput of 40 MB/s per TB
      - Ability to burst up to 250 MB/s per TB
      - Maximum throughput of 500 MB/s per volume
      - Frequently accessed, thoughput-intensive workloads
      - Big data, data warehouses, ETL, and log processing
      - A cost-effect way to store mountains of data
      - Cannot be a boot volume

    Cold HDD (SC1)
      - lowest cost option
      - Baseline throughput of 12 MB/s per TB
      - Ability to burst up to 80 MB/s per TB
      - Maximum throughput of 250 MB/s per volume
      - A good choice for colder data requiring fewer scans per day
      - Good for apps that need the lowest cost and performance is not a factor
      - Cannot be a boot volume
