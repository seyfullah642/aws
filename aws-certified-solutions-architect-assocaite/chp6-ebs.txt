EBS (Elastic Block Storage) Overview

  EBS
    - Storage volumes you can attach to your EC2 instances
    - Create a file system
    - Run a database
    - Run an operating system
    - Store data
    - Install apps

  Mission Critical
    - Production Workloads: Designed for mission-critical workloads
    - Highly Available: Automatically replicated within a single AZ to protect against hardware failure
    - Scalable: Dynamically increase capacity and change the volume type with no downtime or performance impact to your live systems

  EBS Volume Types: Solid State Disk 
    - General Purpose SSD (gp2): A Balance of price and performance

    GP2
      - 3 IOPS per GiB, up to a maximum of 16,000 IOPS per volume
      - gp2 volumes smaller than 1TB can burst up to 3,000 IOPS
      - Good for boot volumes or development and test apps that are not latency Sensitive
    
    GP3
      - Predictable 3,000 IOPS baseline performance and 125 MiB/s regardless of volume size
      - Ideal for app that require high performance at a low cost, such as MySQL, Cassandra, virtual desktop, and Hadoop analytics
      - Customers looking for higher performance can scale up to 16,000 IOPS and 1,000 MiB/s for an additional fee
      - The top performance of gp3 is 4 times faster than max throughput of gp2 volumes

    Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1)
      - The high-performance option and the most expensive
      - Up to 64,000 IOPS per volume. 50 IOPS per GiB
      - Use if you need more than 16,000 IOPS
      - Designed for I/O-intensive apps, large databases, and latency-sensitive workloads

    Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2)
      - Latest generation
      - Higher durability and more IOPS
      - Up to 64,000 IOPS per volume. 500 IOPS per GiB
      - 99.999% durability

  EBS Volume Types: Hard Disk Drive (MB/s-Instensive)
    
    Optimized HDD (st1)
      - Low-cost HDD volume
      - Baseline throughput of 40 MB/s per TB
      - Ability to burst up to 250 MB/s per TB
      - Maximum throughput of 500 MB/s per volume
      - Frequently accessed, thoughput-intensive workloads
      - Big data, data warehouses, ETL, and log processing
      - A cost-effect way to store mountains of data
      - Cannot be a boot volume

    Cold HDD (SC1)
      - lowest cost option
      - Baseline throughput of 12 MB/s per TB
      - Ability to burst up to 80 MB/s per TB
      - Maximum throughput of 250 MB/s per volume
      - A good choice for colder data requiring fewer scans per day
      - Good for apps that need the lowest cost and performance is not a factor
      - Cannot be a boot volume

  IOPS vs Throughput

    IOPS
      - Measures the number of read and write operations per second
      - Imoprtant metric for quick transactions, low latency apps, transactional workloads
      - The ability to action reads and writes very quickly
      - Choose provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 or io2)

    Throughput
      - Measures the number of bits read or writtent per second (MB/s)
      - Important metric for large datasets, large I/O sizes, complex queries
      - The ability to deal with large datasets
      - Choose Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)

Volumes and Snapshots

  What are Volumes?
    - Volumes exists on EBS
    - Think of it as a virtual hard Disk
    - Volumes are simply virtual hard disks. You need a minimum of 1 volume per ec2 instance. This is called the root device volume

  What are Snapshots?
    - Snapshots exist on S3
    - Snapshots are point in time
    - Snapshots are incremental: Only the data that has been changed since you last snapshot are moved to S3
    - First Snapshot: May take some time to create as there is no previous point-in-time copy

  What to know about EBS Volumes
    - EBS volume will always be in the same AZ as ec2
    - Resize on the fly: No need to stop or restart instance. However, you will need to extend the filesystem in the OS so the OS can see the resized volume
    - Switch volume types i.e. from gp2 to io2

Protecting EBS Volumes with Encryption

  EBS Encryption
    - Uses industry-standard AES-256 algorithm
    - Also uses AWS KMS (Key Management Service) CMK (customer master keys) when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots

  What happens when you encrypt an EBS volume?
    - Data at rest is encrypted inside the volume
    - All data in flight moving between the instances and volume is encrypted
    - All snapshots are encrypted
    - All volumes created from the snapshots are encrypted

  EBS encryption
    - Handled Transparently: Encryption and decryption are handled transparently (You don't need to do anything)
    - Latency: Encryption has minimal latency
    - Copying: Copying an unencrypted snapshot allows for encryption
    - Snapshots: Snapshots of encrypted volumes are encrypted
    - Root Device Volumes: You can now encrypt root device volumes upon creation

EC Hibernation

  What you need to know about EC2 Hibernation
    - EC2 hibernation preserves the in-memory RAM on persistent storage (EBS)
    - Much faster to boot up because you do not need to reload the OS
    - Instance RAM must be less than 150GB
    - Instance families include instances in General Purpose, Compute, Memory and Storage Optimized groups
    - Available for Windows, AL2 AMI, and Ubuntu
    - Instances can't be hibernated for more than 60 days
    - Available for On-Demand instances and Reserved instances

EFS Overview

  What to Remember about EFS
    - Supports the Network File System version 4 (NFSv4) protocol
    - Only pay for the storage you use (no pre-provisioning required)
    - Can scale up to petabytes
    - Can support thousands of concurrent NGS connections
    - Data is stored across multiple AZs within a region
    - Read-after-write consistency
    - Bonus Tip: If you have a scenario-based question around highly scalable shared storage using NFS, think EFS

FSx Overview

  What is FSx for Windows?
    - A Window File Server provides a fully managed native Microsoft Windows file system so you can easily move your Windows-based applications that
      require file storage to AWS
    - AWS FSx is built on Windows Server

  FSx for Lustre
    - A fully managed file system that is optimized for compute-intensive workloads
      - HPC
      - ML
      - Media data processing workflows

  Exam Tips
    - EFS: When you need distributed, highly resilent storage for Linux instances and Linux-based apps
    - AWS FSx for Windows: This is essentially just for Windows apps
    - AWS FSx for Lustre: When you need high-speed, high-capacity distributed storage
