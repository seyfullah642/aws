EC2 Overview

  EC2 Pricing Options
    - On-Demand: Pay by the hour or the second, depending on the type of instance you run
    - Reserved: Reserved capacity for 1 or 3 years. Up to 72% discount on the hourly charge
    - Spot: Purchase unused capacity at a discount of up to 90%. Prices fluctuate with supple and demand
    - Dedicated: A physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. The most expensive option

  On-Demand Instances
    - Flexible: Low cost and flexibility of the AWS EC2 without upfront payment or long-term commitment
    - Short-Term: Apps with short-term, spiky, or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted
    - Testing the Water: Apps being developed or tested on AWS EC2 for the first time

  Reserved Instances
    - Predictable Usage: Apps with steady state or predictable usage
    - Specific Capacity Requirements: Apps that require reserved capacity
    - Pay up Front: You can make upfront payments to reduce the total computing costs even further
    - Standard RIs (Reserved Instance): Up to 72% off the on-demand price
    - Convertiable RIs: Up to 54% off the on-demand price. Has the option to change to a different RI type of equal or
      greater value
    - Scheduled RIs: Launch within the time window you define. Match your capacity reservation to predictable recurring schedule
      that only requires a fraction of a day, week, or month
    - Operate at a regional level

  When to Use Spot Instance
    - Flexible: Apps that have flexible start and end times
    - Cost Sensitive: Apps that are only feasible at very low compute prices
    - Urgent Capacity: Users with an urgent need for large amounts of additional computing capacity
    - Ex: Image rendering, Genomic Sequencing, Algorithmic trading engines

  Dedicated Hosts
    - Compliance: Regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization
    - On-Demand: Can be purchased on-demand (hourly)
    - Licensing: Great for licensing that does not support multi-tenancy or cloud deployments
    - Reserved: Can be purchased as a reservation for up to 70% off the on-demand price

Using Roles

  What is an IAM Role
    - A role is an identity that you can create in IAM that has specific permissions. A role is similar to a user, as it is
      an AWS Identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS
    - However, instead of being uniquely associated with one person, a role is intended to be assumable by anyone who needs it

  Roles are Temporary
    - A role does not have standard long-term credentials the same way passwords or access keys do. Instead, when you assume
      a role, it provides you with a temporary security credentials for your role session
    
  What Else Can Roles Do?
    - Roles can be assumed by people, AWS architecture, or other system-level accounts
    - Roles can allow cross account access. This allows one AWS account the ability to interact with resources in other AWS
      accounts

  Exam Tips
  
    What to Remember When Using Roles
      - The perferred option: Roles are preferred from a security perspective
      - Avoid hard-coding your credentials: Roles allow you to provide access without the use of access key IDs and secret 
        access key
      - Policies: Policies control role's permissions
      - Updates: You can update a policy attached to a role, and it will take immediate effect
      - Attaching and Detaching: You can attach and detach roles to running EC2 instances without having to stop or terminate
        those instances

Security Groups and BootStrap Scripts

  Security Groups
    - Security groups are virtual firewalls for your EC2 instance. By default, everything is blocked
    - To let everything in: 0.0.0.0/0
    - In order to communicate with your EC2 instance, will need to open up the correct ports

  BootStrap Scripts
    - A script that runs when the instance first runs

  Exam Tips
    - Changes to security groups take effect immediately
    - You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group
    - You can have multiple security groups attached to an EC2 instances
    - All inbound traffic is blocked by default
    - All outbound traffic is allowed

############################################################

EC2 MetaData and User Data
  - Simply data about your EC2 instance
  - Ex: private IP, public IP, address, hostname, security groups, etc.

Bootstrap Script is aka User Data

Networking with EC2

  You can attach 3 different types of virtual network cards to your EC2
    - ENI (Elastic Network Interface)
      - For basic day-to-day Networking
    - EN (Enhanced Networking)
      - Uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high performance
    - EFA (Elastic Fabric Adapter)
      - Accelerates High Performance Computing (HPC) and machine learning apps

Optimizing with EC2 Placement Groups

  3 Types of Placement Groups
    - Cluster
    - Spread
    - Partition

  Cluster Placement Group
    - Grouping of instance within a single availability zone. Recommended for apps that need low network latency, high network
      throughput, or both
    - Fact: Only certain instance types can be launched into a cluster placement group
  
  Spread Placement Group
    - Group of instances that are each placed on distinct underlying hardware
    - Recommended for apps that have small number of critical instances that should be kept separate from one another
    - Used on different instances

  Parition Placement Group
    - EC2 divides each group into logical segments called partitions
    - Used for multiple instances

Solving License Issues with Dedicated Hosts

  Exam Tips
    - Any question that talks about special licensing requirements, think about Dedicated Hosts

Timing Workloads with Spot Instances and Spot Fleets

  EC2 Spot Instances
    - let you take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS Cloud. Spot Instances are available at up to a 90% discount compared
      to On-Demand prices

  When to Use Spot Instances
    - Stateless, fault-tolerant, or flexible applications
    - Apps such as big data, containerized workloads, CI/CD, HPC, and other test and development workloads

  Spot Prices
    - To use Spot Instances, you must first decide on your maximum Spot price. The instance will be provisioned so long as the Spot price
      is BELOW your maximum Spot price
    - The hourly Spot price varies depending on capacity and region
    - If the Spot price goes above your maximum, you have 2 minutes to choose whether to stop or terminate your instance
    - AWS provides Spot pricing history. This way you can look, choose your region, and maximum

  Use Cases (Good for)
    - Big data and analytics
    - Containerized workloads
    - CI/CD and testing
    - Image and media rendering
    - HPC

  Use Cases (Not good for)
    - Persistent workloads (websites)
    - Critical jobs
    - Databases

  Terminating Spot Instances with persitent Request type
    - Cancel Spot request
    - Terminate instances

  Lanch Pools
    - Spot Fleets will try and match the target capacity with your price restraints
    - Set up different launch pools. Define things like EC2 instance type, operating system, and AZ
    - You can have multiple pools, and the fleet will choose the best way to implement depending on the strategy you define
    - Spot fleets will stop launching instance once you reach your price threshold or capacity desire

  Strategies for Spot Fleets
    - capacityOptimized
    - LowestPrice
    - diversified
    - InstancePoolsToUseCount

Deploying vCenter in AWS with VMware Cloud on AWS

  Why Use VMware
    - VMware is used by orgs around the world for private cloud deployments. Some orgs opt for a hybrid cloud strategy and would
      like to leverage AWS services

  Use Cases for VMware
    - Hybrid Cloud: Connect you on-prem cloud to the AWS public cloud, and manage hybrid workload
    - Cloud Migration: migrating existing cloud envs to AWS using VMware's built-in tools
    - Disaster Recovery: VMware is famous for its disaster recover tech. Using hybrid cloud, you can have an inexpensive disaster recovery 
      env on AWS
    - Leverage AWS: Use over 200 AWS services to update your applications or to create new ones

  VMware Cloud on AWS (How is it deployed?)
    - It runs on dedicated hardware hosted in AWS using a single AWS account
    - Each host has two sockets with 18 cores per socket, 512 GiB RAM, and 15.2 TB Raw SSD storage
    - Each host is capable of running multiple VMware instances (up to hundreds)
    - Clusters can start with two hosts up to a max of 16 hosts per cluster
