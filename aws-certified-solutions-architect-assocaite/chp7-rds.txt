  RDS is for OLTP Workloads
    - Great for processing lots of small transactions, like customer orders, banking transaction, payments, and booking systems

Increasing Read Performance with Read Replicas

  Multi-AZ
    - An exact copy of your production database in another AZ
    - Used for disaster recovery
    - In the event of a failure, RDS will automatically fail over to the standby instance

  Read Replica
    - A read-only copy of your primary database in the same AZ, cross-AZ, or cross-region
    - Used to increase or scale read performance
    - Great for read-heavy workloads and takes the load off your primary database for read-only workloads (e.g. Business Intelligence reporting jobs)
