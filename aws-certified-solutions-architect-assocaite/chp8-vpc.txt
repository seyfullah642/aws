VPC Overview

  What is a VPC?
    - Think of a VPC as a virtual data center in the cloud
    - Logically isolated part of AWS Cloud where you can define your own network
    - Complete control of virtual network, including your own IP address range, subnets, route tables, and network gateways

  Fully Customizable Network
    - You can leverage multiple layers of security, including SGs and NACLs, to help control access to Amazon EC2 instances in
      each subnet

      Web: Public facing
      Application: Private subnet. Can only speak to web tier and database tier
      Database: Private subnet. Can only speak to application tier

  VPNs
    - Additionally, you can create a hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between your corporate data center and your
      VPC and leverage the AWS Cloud as an extension of your corporate data center

  VPC Features

    What can we do with a VPC?
      - Launch Instances: Launch instances into a subnet of your choosing
      - Custome IP Addresses: Assign custom IP adress ranges in each subnet
      - Route Tables: Configure route tables between subnets
      - Internet Gateway: Create internet gateway and attach it to our VPC
      - More Control: Much better security control over your AWS resources
      - Access Control Lists: Subnet network access control Lists
      - BONUS TIP: You can use network access control lists (NACLs) to block specific IP addresses

  Exam Tips
    - 1 subnet is always in 1 availability zone

Demo: Provisioning a VPC part 1

  Exam Tips
    - Think of a VPC as a logical data center in AWS
    - Consists of internet gateways (or virtual private gateways), route tables, NACLs, subnets, and SGs
    - 1 subnet is always in 1 availability zone

Demo: Provisioning a VPC part 2
   
  Internet Gateway 
    - Required for subnets to be public
    - Used to access VPC
    - Can only attach one VPC

  Route Table
    - Gives a way out to the Internet Gateway
    - 0.0.0.0/0 is for the outside world
    - Need to associate subnet we want public in RTB

  VPC Creation workflow
    - VPC 
    - Subnet (attach subnets to VPC) 
    - Internet Gateway (attach VPC to internet)
    - Route Table (attach to VPC ensure proper association of subnets)

Using NAT Gateways for Internet Access

  NAT Gateways
    - You can use a network address translation (NAT) gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other
      AWS services while preventing the internet from initiating a connection with those innstances
    - You provision NAT Gateway in public subnet
    - Same AZ as subnet

  5 Facts to Remember about NAT Gateways
    - Redundant inside the AZ
    - Starts at 5 Gbps and scales currently to 45 Gbps
    - No need to patch
    - Not associated with SGs
    - Automatically assigned a public address

Protecting Your Resources with SGs

  How Computers Communicate
    - Linux: SSH port 22
    - Windows: RDP port 3389
    - HTTP: Web browsing port 80
    - HTTPS: Encrypted Web Browsing (SSL) 443

  What Are Security Groups?
    - SGs are virtual firewalls for an EC2 instance. By default, everything is blocked
    - To let everything in: 0.0.0.0/0
    - In order to communicate to your EC2 instances via SSH, RDP, or HTTP, you will need to open up the correct ports

  Exam Tip
    - SGs are stateful -- if you send a reques from your instance, the reponse traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of
      inbound SG rules
    - Response to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of outbound rules

Controlling Subnet Traffic with NACLs

  What is a NACL?
    - The first line of defense
    - A network access control list (ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in
      and out of one or more subnets
    - You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your SGs in order to add another layer of security to your VPC

  Network ACLs Overview
    - Default NACLs: Your VPC automatically comes with a default NACL, and by default it allows all outbound and inbound traffic
    - Custome NACLs: You can create custome network ACLs. By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until
      you add rules
    - Subnet Association: Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a NACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a NACL,
      the subnet is automatically associated with the default NACL
    - Block IP Addresses: Block IP addresses using NACL, not SGs
