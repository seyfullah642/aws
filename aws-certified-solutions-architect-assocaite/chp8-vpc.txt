VPC Overview

  What is a VPC?
    - Think of a VPC as a virtual data center in the cloud
    - Logically isolated part of AWS Cloud where you can define your own network
    - Complete control of virtual network, including your own IP address range, subnets, route tables, and network gateways

  Fully Customizable Network
    - You can leverage multiple layers of security, including SGs and NACLs, to help control access to Amazon EC2 instances in
      each subnet

      Web: Public facing
      Application: Private subnet. Can only speak to web tier and database tier
      Database: Private subnet. Can only speak to application tier

  VPNs
    - Additionally, you can create a hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between your corporate data center and your
      VPC and leverage the AWS Cloud as an extension of your corporate data center

  VPC Features

    What can we do with a VPC?
      - Launch Instances: Launch instances into a subnet of your choosing
      - Custome IP Addresses: Assign custom IP adress ranges in each subnet
      - Route Tables: Configure route tables between subnets
      - Internet Gateway: Create internet gateway and attach it to our VPC
      - More Control: Much better security control over your AWS resources
      - Access Control Lists: Subnet network access control Lists
      - BONUS TIP: You can use network access control lists (NACLs) to block specific IP addresses

  Exam Tips
    - 1 subnet is always in 1 availability zone

Demo: Provisioning a VPC part 1

  Exam Tips
    - Think of a VPC as a logical data center in AWS
    - Consists of internet gateways (or virtual private gateways), route tables, NACLs, subnets, and SGs
    - 1 subnet is always in 1 availability zone

############################################################

Demo: Provisioning a VPC part 2
   
  Internet Gateway 
    - Required for subnets to be public
    - Used to access VPC
    - Can only attach one VPC

  Route Table
    - Gives a way out to the Internet Gateway
    - 0.0.0.0/0 is for the outside world
    - Need to associate subnet we want public in RTB

  VPC Creation workflow
    - VPC 
    - Subnet (attach subnets to VPC) 
    - Internet Gateway (attach VPC to internet)
    - Route Table (attach to VPC ensure proper association of subnets)

############################################################

Using NAT Gateways for Internet Access

  NAT Gateways
    - You can use a network address translation (NAT) gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other
      AWS services while preventing the internet from initiating a connection with those innstances
    - You provision NAT Gateway in public subnet
    - Same AZ as subnet

  5 Facts to Remember about NAT Gateways
    - Redundant inside the AZ
    - Starts at 5 Gbps and scales currently to 45 Gbps
    - No need to patch
    - Not associated with SGs
    - Automatically assigned a public address

############################################################

Protecting Your Resources with SGs

  How Computers Communicate
    - Linux: SSH port 22
    - Windows: RDP port 3389
    - HTTP: Web browsing port 80
    - HTTPS: Encrypted Web Browsing (SSL) 443

  What Are Security Groups?
    - SGs are virtual firewalls for an EC2 instance. By default, everything is blocked
    - To let everything in: 0.0.0.0/0
    - In order to communicate to your EC2 instances via SSH, RDP, or HTTP, you will need to open up the correct ports

  Exam Tip
    - SGs are stateful -- if you send a reques from your instance, the reponse traffic for that request is allowed to flow in regardless of
      inbound SG rules
    - Response to allowed inbound traffic are allowed to flow out, regardless of outbound rules

############################################################

Controlling Subnet Traffic with NACLs

  What is a NACL?
    - The first line of defense
    - A network access control list (ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in
      and out of one or more subnets
    - You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your SGs in order to add another layer of security to your VPC

  Network ACLs Overview
    - Default NACLs: Your VPC automatically comes with a default NACL, and by default it allows all outbound and inbound traffic
    - Custome NACLs: You can create custome network ACLs. By default, each custom network ACL denies all inbound and outbound traffic until
      you add rules
    - Subnet Association: Each subnet in your VPC must be associated with a NACL. If you don't explicitly associate a subnet with a NACL,
      the subnet is automatically associated with the default NACL
    - Block IP Addresses: Block IP addresses using NACL, not SGs

Private Communication Using VPC Endpoints

  VPC Endpoints
    - Enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an
      internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connection connection
    - Instances in your VPC do not require public IP addresses to communicate with resources in the service
    - Traffic between your VPC and other service does not leave the Amazon network

  Study Tip
    - Endpoints are virtual devices
    - They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components that allow communication between instances in your VPC and services
      without imposing availability risks or bandwidth constraints on your network traffic

  2 types of Endpoints
    
    Interface Endpoints
      - An elastic network interface with a private IP address that serve as an entry point for traffic headed to a supported service. They support a
        large number of AWS services

    Gateway Endpoints
      - Similar to NAT gateways, a gateway endpoint is a virtual device you provision. It supports connection to S3 and DynamoDB

Building Solutions across VPCs with Peering

  Multiple VPCs
    - Sometimes you may need to have several VPCs for different envs and it may be necessary to connect these VPCs to each other

  VPC Peering
    - Allows you to connect 1 VPC with another via a direct network route using private IP addresses
    - Instances behave as if they were on the same private network
    - You can peer VPCs with other AWS accounts as well as with other VPCs in the same account
    - Peering is in a star configuration
    - You can peer between regions
    - No overlapping CIDR address range

############################################################

Network Privacy with AWS PrivateLink

  Using PrivateLink
    - Best way to expose a service VPC to tens, hundreds, or thousands of customer VPCs
    - Doesn't require VPC peering; no route tables, NAT gateways, internet gateways, etc
    - Requires a Network Load Balancer on the service VPC and an ENI on the customer VPC

############################################################

Securing Your Network with VPN CloudHub

  AWS VPN CloudHub
    - If you have multiple sites, each with its own VPN connection, you can use AWS VPN CloudHub to connect those sites together
    - Hub-n-spoke model
    - Low cost and easy to manage
    - It operates over the public internet, but all traffic between the customer gateway and the AWS VPN CloudHub is encrypted

############################################################

Connecting On-Premises with Direct Connect

  Private Connectivity
    - Using AWS Direct Connect, you can establish private connectivity between AWS and your data center or office
    - In many cases, you can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based
      connections

  2 Types of Direct Connect Connection
    - Dedicated Connection: A physical ethernet connection
    - Hosted Connection: A physical ethernet connection with a AWS Direct Connect Partner i.e. Version, At&t

  VPNs vs. Direct Connect
    - VPNs allow private communication, but it still traverses the public internet to get the data delivered. While secure, it can be painfully slow
    - Direct Connect is Fast, Secure, Reliable, and able to take massive throughput

Simplifying Networks with Transit Gateway

  Transit Gateway
    - Connects VPCs and on-premise networks through a central hub. This simplifies your network and puts an end to complex peering relationships. It acts as
      a cloud routers -- each new connection is only made once

  Transit Gateway Facts
    - Allows you to have transitive peering between thousands of VPCs and on-premise data centers
    - Works on a hub-n-spoke model
    - Works on a regional basis, but you can have it across multiple regions
    - You can use it across multiple AWS accounts using RAM (Resource Access Manager)

  Exam Tips
    - You can use route tables to limit how VPCs talk to one another
    - Works with Direct Connect as well as VPN connections
    - Supports IP multicast (not supported by any other AWS service)
